# GitHub User Search

This project is a simple GitHub User Search application built using [Vite](https://vitejs.dev/) and [React](https://reactjs.org/). The app allows users to search for GitHub profiles by username and displays relevant information such as the user's avatar, name, bio, number of repositories, followers, and following.

## Features

- **Fast and Lightweight:** Powered by Vite for rapid development and React for efficient UI rendering.
- **Responsive Design:** The app is fully responsive and works seamlessly on both desktop and mobile devices.
- **User-Friendly Interface:** Easy-to-use search functionality with a clean and modern UI.
- **API Integration:** Fetches user data in real-time using the GitHub REST API.
- **Error Handling:** Displays appropriate messages if the user is not found or in case of any errors during the fetch process.
